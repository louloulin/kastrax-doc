# Kastrax Cloud ✅

Kastrax Cloud is a deployment service built by the Kastrax team that runs, manages, and monitors Kastrax applications. It works with standard Kastrax projects and handles deployment, scaling, and operational tasks. It is currently in beta.

## Core Functionality

- **Atomic Deployments** - Agents and workflows deploy as a single unit
- **Project Organization** - Group agents and workflows into projects with assigned URLs
- **Environment Variables** - Store configuration securely by environment
- **Testing Console** - Send messages to agents through a web interface
- **Execution Tracing** - Record agent interactions and tool calls
- **Workflow Visualization** - Display workflow steps and execution paths
- **Logs** - Standard logging output for debugging
- **Platform Compatibility** - Uses the same infrastructure as Cloudflare, Vercel, and Netlify deployers

## Dashboard Components

The Kastrax Cloud dashboard contains:

- **Projects List** - All projects in the account
- **Project Details** - Deployments, environment variables, and access URLs
- **Deployment History** - Record of deployments with timestamps and status
- **Agent Inspector** - Agent configuration view showing models, tools, and system prompts
- **Testing Console** - Interface for sending messages to agents
- **Trace Explorer** - Records of tool calls, parameters, and responses
- **Workflow Viewer** - Diagram of workflow steps and connections

## Technical Implementation

Kastrax Cloud runs on the same core code as the platform-specific deployers with these modifications:

- **Edge Network Distribution** - Geographically distributed execution
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation** - Adjusts compute resources based on traffic
- **Kastrax-specific Runtime** - Runtime optimized for agent execution
- **Standard Deployment API** - Consistent deployment interface across environments
- **Tracing Infrastructure** - Records all agent and workflow execution steps

## Use Cases

Common usage patterns:

- Deploying applications without managing infrastructure
- Maintaining staging and production environments
- Monitoring agent behavior across many requests
- Testing agent responses through a web interface
- Deploying to multiple regions
