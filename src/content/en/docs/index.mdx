# About Kastrax ✅

Kastrax is an open-source Kotlin agent framework that combines the power of the actor model with advanced AI capabilities.

It's designed to give you the essential primitives you need to build distributed, scalable AI applications and features.

You can use Kastrax to build [AI agents](/docs/agents/overview.mdx) ✅ with memory and tool-calling capabilities, implement deterministic LLM workflows, and leverage RAG for knowledge integration. With features like agent versioning, performance monitoring, and distributed communication protocols, Kastrax provides a complete toolkit for developing, testing, and deploying AI applications.

The main features include:

* **Multiple LLM Integrations** ✅: Kastrax provides a unified interface to interact with various LLM providers including DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini.
* **[Agent architectures](/docs/agents/architectures.mdx)** ✅: Kastrax offers multiple agent architectures including Adaptive, Goal-Oriented, Hierarchical, Reflective, and Creative agents.
* **[Agent memory](/docs/memory/overview.mdx)** ✅: With Kastrax, you can give your agent different types of memory. You can persist agent memory and retrieve it based on recency, semantic similarity, or conversation thread.
* **[Tool system](/docs/tools/overview.mdx)** ✅: Kastrax provides a flexible tool system that allows agents to interact with external systems and perform various functions.
* **[Workflow engine](/docs/workflows/overview.mdx)** ✅: When you want to execute LLM calls in a deterministic way, Kastrax gives you a powerful workflow engine. You can define discrete steps, handle errors, and manage state across steps.
* **[Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/rag/overview.mdx)** ✅: Kastrax gives you APIs to process documents into chunks, create embeddings, and store them in a vector database. At query time, it retrieves relevant chunks to ground LLM responses in your data.
* **[Actor model](/docs/actor/overview.mdx)** ✅: Kastrax integrates with the kactor library to provide a distributed actor system for building scalable and resilient agent applications.
* **[Agent versioning](/docs/agents/versioning.mdx)** ✅: Kastrax supports agent versioning, allowing you to create, manage, and roll back different versions of your agents.
* **[Observability](/docs/observability/overview.mdx)** ✅: Kastrax provides comprehensive observability features including metrics collection, behavior analysis, and visualization tools for monitoring agent performance.
* **[A2A Protocol](/docs/a2a/overview.mdx)** ✅: Kastrax implements the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for standardized communication between agents, enabling complex multi-agent systems.
